### For Readers

This repository contains my solution for **EC413 Computer Organization - Lab 2b: MIPS Assembly Language Programming**. The objective of this lab is to develop proficiency in MIPS assembly programming through a series of tasks involving input/output operations, loops, conditionals, and data manipulation.

### Overview

This lab focuses on developing skills in MIPS Assembly Language, covering fundamental operations such as:
- Input/Output operations
- Loops and nested loops
- Data transfers and conditionals
- Array manipulations

The primary goal is to write and debug MIPS assembly programs while adhering to coding best practices and achieving functional correctness across various input sizes.

### Tasks

#### Prelab Tasks
1. **Program Setup**
   - Enter the provided program outline (`lab2b.asm`) and ensure it loads and executes correctly.
   - Expected output: "Hello World!" followed by printed numbers starting with `17`.

2. **Modify Output String**
   - Locate the code that prints the string and update it to display your name.

3. **Printing Numbers**
   - Modify the code to print two integer values separated by a space using syscalls.

#### Lab Tasks

4. **Array Manipulations**
   - Modify code to print spaces between array elements.
   - Update the code to print the array in reverse order.

5. **Copying Data**
   - Modify the program to copy data one word at a time instead of byte-by-byte.

6. **Computing Average**
   - Write code to calculate and print the integer average of array `Input2`.

7. **Conditional Statements**
   - Display the first 25 integers divisible by 7, ensuring spaces between outputs.

#### Extra Credit

8. **Matrix Transposition (10 pts)**
   - Implement nested loops or index arithmetic to transpose a dynamically initialized 10x10 byte array.

### Instructions to Run
1. Save `lab2b.asm` to your device.
2. Open a MIPS simulator (e.g., SPIM or MARS).
3. Load and execute the program.
