### For Readers

This repository contains all of my labs from EC413: Computer Organization course at Boston University, which I took in the fall of my 3rd (Junior) year. Each lab folder contains a LabDescription file which will provide a much more in depth breakdown of each lab assignment and what I accomplished, which will give you as the reader a better understanding of what's going on as your musing through the files. I've also renamed each lab so their title is more relevant to what the lab assignment entailed, but the original order is as follows (Note that Labs 3 and below are subfolders within *Verilog*):

- Lab 1: Not shown
- Lab 2a: Not shown
- Lab 2b: *MIPS*
- Lab 3: *BuildingAdders*
- Lab 4: *32bitALU*
- Lab 5: *PipelinedDatapath*
- Lab 6: *SingleCycleProcessor*
- Lab 7: *PipelinedCPU*
